# ChromaSpace
ChromaSpace is a Space-invader inspired game based on pygame. The game was programmed as part of a school assignment.

# Game principle
The principle is quite simple. Dodge the meteors and try to score as many points as possible. You get one point for each passing meteorite. You can get special points by collecting blue gems. 

You have three lives per round. To replenish your lives during a round, you can collect Red Gems. When you run out of lives, you are dead and the round is over.

# Extensions
If you want to try my game, you should download the necessary Python extensions.

```
pip install pygame, random, os
```
