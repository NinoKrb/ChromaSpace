# ChromaSpace
ChromaSpace is a Space-invader inspired game based on pygame. The game was programmed as part of a school assignment.

# Game principle
The principle is quite simple. Dodge the meteors and try to score as many points as possible. You will get one point for each meteorite that passes by. You can get special points if you collect blue gems.

You have three lives per round. To replenish your lives during a round, you can collect red gems. When you run out of lives, you are dead and the round is over.

A special feature is the teleporter, which can be executed using the spacebar. The booster teleports you to a free place on the board, it helps you in difficult game situations.

The game principle is basically infinite, depending on the score, the difficulty level becomes more difficult, so the meteor shower becomes much more filled.

# Extensions
If you want to try my game, you should download the necessary Pygame Python extension.

To install it you can run this command
```
pip install pygame
```
